Take-home Assessment 7: Personality

## Background
_Note: You do not need to read this section to complete the assessment, but it provides some helpful context that may make the assessment easier to understand._

In this assessment, you will be writing a program to process the results of a personality test known as the Keirsey Temperament Sorter. The Keirsey personality test involves answering 70 questions by choosing one of two answers. The Keirsey test measures four independent dimensions of personality:
- Extrovert versus Introvert (E vs I): what energizes you
- Sensation versus iNtuition (S vs N): what you focus on
- Thinking versus Feeling (T vs F): how you interpret what you focus on
- Judging versus Perceiving (J vs P): how you approach life

Individuals are categorized as being on one side or the other of each of these dimensions. The corresponding letters are put together to form a personality type. For example, if you are an extrovert, intuitive, thinking, perceiving person then you are referred to as an ENTP. Usually the letter used is the first letter of the corresponding word, but notice that because the letter "I" is used for "Introvert", the letter "N" is used for "iNtuition."

## Program Behavior
This program will process an input file containing the results of a personality test for a number of people and determine each personâ€™s Keirsey personality type. The program will begin by printing a short introduction, and then asking the user for an input file to read and an output file to print results to. The program will then read the given input file and process the responses to the personality test in that file, printing the results to the specified output file. Only the introduction and file prompting should be printed to the console.
